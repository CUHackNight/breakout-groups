# CU Hack Night breakout-groups
The working groups currently in effect for CU Hack Night

Every week at [CU Hack Night](https://cuhacknight.org/), we break out into topic-specific working and learning groups led by regular facilitators to guide conversations, answer questions, and build teams for civic apps. The groups are split into two types: working groups and learning groups.

These groups change from week to week, with some lasting just a single night to others progressing over several years. To keep track of these fluctuating groups, we use GitHub issues to open, close and update groups over time.

You can see the full list of projects on the [CU Hack Night Breakout Groups page](https://CUHackNight.org), or in the [issues list for this GitHub repository](https://github.com/CUHackNight/breakout-groups/issues).
